# AWS Project Brief:

To create a virtual private cloud (VPC) and launch an EC2 instance within a subnet of the VPC in which wordpress will be installed then deployed onto the EC2 instance.

# Aim:

In this project I aim to learn how a VPC works and how a virtual computer can be launched to run a wordpress page. This project will help myself gain an introductory insight on how to run resources such as an EC2 on my virtual private cloud and how to locally connect my cloud computer to my local device in order to deploy a web page on the server
